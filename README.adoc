=== Getting help

*For users looking for help*: a manual describing all possible features of StudyGuide is available in the app itself:
in the upper menu bar item *Help -> Help*.

Post any development questions or comments you may have on Stack Overflow and/or don't hesitate to
https://github.com/oskopek/StudyGuide/issues[open an issue].

=== Running StudyGuide releases

* Download a release from https://github.com/oskopek/StudyGuide/releases[]
* To directly run StudyGuide, download the *executable JAR file*: `StudyGuide-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
* If you want to run a release, just try: `java -jar StudyGuide-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

=== Building & running StudyGuide

* See the section (further down) on How-to setup your *build environment* first.
* *Recommended*: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
* To run *unit tests*: `mvn clean install`
* To run *integration tests*: `mvn clean install -Pit`
* To *clean*, run: `mvn clean`
* *Run StudyGuide*:
** If you followed the build environment setup and want to run your version of StudyGuide,
run `mvn exec:java` from the main project directory.
** If you want to run a translated version of StudyGuide, set your system locale accordingly and restart StudyGuide.
If you want to try out a translated version (on Linux), try: `LC_ALL="LOCALE" java -jar StudyGuide.jar`, where
`LOCALE` is any locale available on your system (run `locale -a` to view all available).

StudyGuide uses http://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

=== Setup your build environment

==== Linux & Mac

. *Install Git*
** Fedora: `sudo dnf install git`
** Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install git`

. *Install Java8 JDK* -- link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle JDK Downloads] -- Select: Java Platform (JDK)
** *NOTE*: You need `jdk-8u40` or newer (JavaFX 8 dependency).

. *Install Maven* -- preferably the latest version you can.
Usually, your distribution's package management repository is enough:
** Fedora: `sudo dnf install mvn`
** Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install maven`

. *Fork the repository* -- Create a fork of the link:https://github.com/oskopek/StudyGuide/[oskopek/StudyGuide repository]
(right upper corner) on GitHub, usually the fork will be called: `yourusername/StudyGuide`.

. *Clone the your fork* -- run `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StudyGuide.git`
 (or, preferably, use SSH: `git clone git@github.com:yourusername/StudyGuide.git`)

. *Run the build* (see the Building section)

==== Windows

. *Install Java8 JDK* -- link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle JDK Downloads] -- Select: Java Platform (JDK)

. *Install Maven* -- (preferably the latest version you can).
See: http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/windows-prerequisites.html[Maven on Windows]
 and http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven Downloads].

. Download and install GitHub for Windows at http://windows.github.com/[]. If you encounter any problems,
see the http://windows.github.com/help.html[GitHub for Windows FAQ].

. Find the `oskopek/StudyGuide` https://github.com/oskopek/StudyGuide[repository] on GitHub.

. Create a fork of the repository (right upper corner), usually the fork will be called `yourusername/StudyGuide`.

. *Run the build* (see the Building section)

. The following workflow may be useful for you, if you're not familiar with Git/GitHub for Windows:

.. In the upper left window, you can view all uncommitted changes.
Write the name and description of your changes and click the *check* button.

.. Once in a while, be sure to *sync* to send all commits to your GitHub fork.

.. After testing your changes, submit a pull request to `oskopek/StudyGuide` through https://github.com/oskopek/StudyGuide/compare[GitHub].
... Click on compare across forks.
... Set the following:
**** base fork: `oskopek/StudyGuide`
**** base: `master`
**** head fork: `yourusername/StudyGuide`
**** compare: `branchname`

.. Click on *Click to create a pull request for this comparison*.

.. Our Travis continuous integration server will test the merge of your pull request.
You can view the results in the thread of the pull request.

.. Congratulations! Your pull request will get reviewed and probably be merged in.

=== Submitting an Issue

=== Data format

For all input and output format, we use JSON.
Currently, the input/output format depends directly on the model, and may be subject to future changes.

==== Data format details

The following is a grammar of the input/output data format. Do note it may be outdated.

*Conventions*:

* JSON uses the character pair `{` and `}` often,
therefore we write zero-or-more repeated statements using `(` and `)*`,
which JSON doesn't use (just like regexes).
* Also, since JSON uses `[` and `]` for lists,
they do not mean an optional statement - we use `(` and `)` (without the star) for that.
* Under `<character>` we assume any valid UTF-8 character.
* Under `<string>` we assume any *valid, non-empty* sequence of UTF-8 characters.
* Under `<integer>` we assume any *non-negative* whole number smaller than or equal to `2^31 - 1`.
